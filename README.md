# Help needed
I need a lot of help with keeping up with correct information from all countries over the world, so if you have information that is not yet shown on the website, please file an issue or do a pull request on this repo.

# Data

The data is provided by people on the ground and different sources on the internet.

If you want to update or add a country just look for the correct country in dist/country-list.json and change the settings.

You can add:

travel - will show text you add and show travel icon
shop 
school
quarantaine
event
health
remark - will replace the BUT below the virus icon
note - Will add a footnote under the icons.

If you can put in a pull request, I try to merge them asap.
If you can't make a pull request either fill out an issue or whatsapp me on +32486362961

# Using the data

You can link and use the json file by doing using https://areweinlockdown.com/country-list.json in your own projects if needed.

# Hosting
